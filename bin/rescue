USAGE = %{
rescue (pry-rescue wrapper)

Usage:
  rescue <script.rb> [arguments...]

What it does:
  Runs <script.rb>, and if an uncaught exception is raised,
  pry will come to the rescue, giving you a pry prompt in the
  context where the exception was raised.

  You can then poke around to figure out why your code broke!

  (Not yet available: fixing the problem and continuing your program.)
